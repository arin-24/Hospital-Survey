# Hospital-Survey
This is my first python project. It is very basic.
I wanted to know how to loop the whole program. 
In my code, there is a condition. If the details summarised are correct, the survey is completed. 
However, if the details are not correct, an 'apology' line will be printed and the program starts back at the top from the first question.
This project is free for editing, please make any improvements:)
